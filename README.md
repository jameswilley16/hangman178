# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Project Title: Hangman

A description of the project: 
During this project, I have coded the game Hangman.
Using OOP:
The game will take in a list of words, choose one at random then you can try and guess the word.
The game takes in a single alphabetic character (prompting you to input another guess if you do not do this) and compares this guess with the list of characters in that word.
If the guess is not present in the word you will lose a life and at zero lives you lost the game.
If the guess is present in the word the letter appears in the list of guessed words and when all the letters are present you have won the game.

What I have learnt:
I greatly improved my OOP understanding - especially defining methods in a class.
I also improved my control flow understanding by using for and while loops with assertions to keep the programme iterating through the different stages of the game.
I encountered lots of errors in my code during the different milestones and doing this project greatly improved by error handling skills and fixing my code.
